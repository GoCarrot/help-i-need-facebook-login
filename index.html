<h1>Help!</h1>
<p>Keep calm. We're going to get through this together. First, what platform is your app on?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#website">App? I have a website</a>
<li><a href="#facebook_canvas">My app is on the Facebook Canvas</a>
<li><a href="#ios">My app is on iOS</a>
<li><a href="#android">My app is on Android</a>
<li><a href="#unity">My app is on iOS or Android and is made with Unity</a>
</ul>
<a name="website"></a>
<h2>App? I have a website.</h2>
  <p>Websites are cool too. Before we get too far into this though, let's make sure you need Facebook Login. Are you just trying to do any of the following?
  <ul>
    <li>I want people to like my website
    <li>I want people to like my Facebook page from my website
    <li>I have articles, pictures, videos, games, etc. on my website that I want people to like
    <li>I want to use Facebook comments
    <li>I want to make it easy for users to share my content on Facebook
  </ul>
  If you don't want anything beyond that list, then great news: You don't need Facebook login! What you're looking for is the relevant Facebook Social Plugin, and possibly a bit of Open Graph magic. Don't worry, we can help with that too. <a href="#later_maybe">Continue your adventure.</a>
